# Stashboard

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twilio/stashboard.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/twilio/stashboard)

Stashboard was written by Twilio to provide status information on our phone, SMS, and Communication APIs. We open sourced the code to provide a generic status page designed to be customized by any hosted services company to provide customers up-to-date status information. The code can be downloaded, customized with your logo, and run on any Google App Engine account.

Tracelytics-specific documentation can be found in the [tracelons wiki](http://github.com/tracelytics/tracelons/wiki/Stashboard).

## Installation

1. Download and install the [App Engine SDK for Python][appengine]
2. `git clone git://github.com/twilio/stashboard.git`
3. Add your application id to `app.yaml`
4. Open the SDK, choose `File > Add Existing Application...` and select the `stashboard` folder inside the cloned repository
5. Update the settings in `settings.py`
6. Visit http://your-app-id.appspot.com/admin/setup to complete the installation

From here you can either run Stashboard locally in the [App Engine development environment][local] or [deploy to Appspot][deploy].
See the [Getting Started](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted) guide for a basic overview of the App Engine platform.
