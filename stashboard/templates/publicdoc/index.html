  <h1>API Overview</h1>
  <p>The API is broken down into three main resources: <a href="/documentation/services">Services</a>, <a href="/documentation/events">Events</a>, and <a href="/documentation/statuses">Statuses</a>.</p>
  <h3>Resource Schema</h3>
  <p>All resources returned will be JSON objects. In the case of a list resource, the JSON object will have a field containing the list of returned resources</p>
  <pre><code>{
    "objects": [
        {
            "id": "foo",
            "descrption": "This is a sample object"
        }
    ]
}</pre></code>
  <h3>Authentication (or lack thereof)</h3>
  <p>No API requests require authentication as all resources are read-only</p>
  <h3>Client Errors</h3>
  <p>Client errors will have the following structure. 
  <pre><code>{
    "message": "Can't find resource",
    "code": 404,
    "error": true
}</pre></code>
